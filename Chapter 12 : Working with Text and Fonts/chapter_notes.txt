    -  we can define font family for the entire page,
    - body {
        font-family: "sans-serif, "Montserrat", "Arial";
    }
    it means first the user browser looks for sans-serif font, if it can find the font use it, else looks
        for a Montserrat, if it can find the montserrat font use it, else ....
        if it cannot find any of the font use the default font that defined for each broser by the user,
        using default font by the browswr could affects our style.

    - we have:
        - Default font (simply not set any font style in the CSS or HTML)
        - Generic font (defined in CSS)
        - Font family (defined in CSS)
            = User's computer
            = Web fonts
            = retrive from server

    - a better approach to use google font is to add the font into the CSS file instead of the html file.
    - importing the ofnt into the CSS file that is shared betwenn all pages is a best palce to add import font
    - simple go to the google font website and when you select the font, use "@IMPORT" instead of "STANDARD"
    - Tjhis method avoid us to make mistakes
     

    in shared.css
    {
        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code:wght@500&display=swap');
    }

    so I simply remove all font loink from the html pages and add them as an import to the shared.css file
