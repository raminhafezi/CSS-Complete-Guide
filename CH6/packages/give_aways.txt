    1- Background Properties
        - background-image: to set image url
        - background-size: Xpx Ypx or X% Y% or auto Y% or auto auto or 
            - Background-size: cover take the entire provided space
            - Background-size: contain shows the full image in the space, might show some blank
                                       space around the image if it couldnot fit into the space.

    2- Background-position:
        The background-position property in CSS allows you to move a background image (or gradient) around 
        within its container.
    

        It has three different types of values:

            Length values (e.g. 100px 5px)
            Percentages (e.g. 100% 5%)
            Keywords (e.g. top right)
            
            - The default values are 0 0. This places your background image at the top left of the container.
            
            - Length values:
                pretty simple: the first value is the horizontal position, second value is the vertical position. 
                So 100px 5px will move the image 100px to the right and five pixels down. You can set length values in px, 
                em, or any of the other CSS length values.
            
            - Percentages:
                work a little differently. moving a background image by X% means it will align the X% point in the 
                image to the X% point in the container. For example, 50% means it will align the middle of the image with the middle 
                of the container. 100% means it will align the last pixel of the image with the last pixel of the container, and so on.

            - Keywords are just shortcuts for percentages. It's easier to remember and write top right than 100% 0, and that's why 
                keywords are a thing. Here is a list of all five keywords and their equivalent values:
                
                top: 0% vertically
                right: 100% horizontally
                bottom: 100% vertically
                left: 0% horizontally
                center: 50% horizontally if horizontal isn't already defined. If it is then this is applied vertically.

                order of the keywords does not matter, top right is the same as right top
