1- We ca select an element with the specific class with the following notation

    <a class="activated"> here is a text </a>

    then in the CSS class to specifically mentioned this ancer tag with the
    class name activated we can write the CSS in this way

    .a.activated {
        background:"blue";
    }

    or when you want to set style to an specific a tag with the id, you can use
    a#id_name {
        color: "black";
    }


2- we prefer to use class for adding style to an html element not an ID,
    with the class we can also attach it to the javascript, which is boundle alot with the html
    so, adding class to the html element is our first priority. 

    ID-selectors is only used whne you want to add style to one element in your page.
    this is the only usage of the adding id to the html element.

    in the page we can assign the reference to the id, for example we can 
    use id to the href of the a tag to navigate to different seciton of the4 page from the menu
    
    <a href="#id_name"> go to this part of the page </a>
    ....
    ....
    ....
    <section id="id_name"> welcome to this part of the page </section>
    
3- !important

    we can assign !important to any style in the css file. and it means this style is the highest specifity.

    a {
        background: #light_blue" !important;
    }

    using !importamt is not a good idea and it is not recommended.

4- not
    not is use when we want to add style to an element that does not have an specific features
    for example we want to add style to a elements in the class which are not activated

    in the css we add

    a:not(.active) {
        color:blue;    }


    using not is not recomended because we can always use positive way.
