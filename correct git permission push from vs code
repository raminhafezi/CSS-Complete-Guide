Git Push Error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database

when you want to push changes from Visual Studio Code in linux mint,

Go to your git repo directory in your project and then



cd /path/to/repo.git
sudo chgrp -R groupname .
sudo chmod -R g+rwX .
find . -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' +


ote if you want everyone to be able to modify the repository, 
you don't need the chgrp and you will want to change the chmod to 
    sudo chmod -R a+rwX .

Repair Permissions
After you have identified and fixed the underlying cause (see below), you'll want to repair the permissions:

cd /path/to/repo.git
sudo chgrp -R groupname .
sudo chmod -R g+rwX .
find . -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' +
Note if you want everyone to be able to modify the repository, you don't need the chgrp and you will want to change the chmod to sudo chmod -R a+rwX .

If you do not fix the underlying cause, the error will keep coming back and you'll have to keep re-running the above commands over and over again.

Underlying Causes
The error could be caused by one of the following:

The repository isn't configured to be a shared repository (see core.sharedRepository in git help config). If the output of:

git config core.sharedRepository
is not group or true or 1 or some mask, try running:

git config core.sharedRepository group
and then re-run the recursive chmod and chgrp (see "Repair Permissions" above).

The operating system doesn't interpret a setgid bit on directories as "all new files and subdirectories should inherit the group owner".

When core.sharedRepository is true or group, Git relies on a feature of GNU operating systems (e.g., every Linux distribution) to ensure that 
newly created subdirectories are owned by the correct group
 (the group that all of the repository's users are in). This feature is documented in the GNU coreutils documentation:
