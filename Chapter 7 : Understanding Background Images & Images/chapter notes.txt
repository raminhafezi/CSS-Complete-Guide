    background-origin:
        The background-origin property is used to determine how the background-position of a background in a certain box is calculated.
        It takes three different values, border-box, padding-box and content-box. When you supply a value of padding-box, the position 
        is relative to the upper left corner of the padding edge. With border-box itâ€™s relative to the upper left corner of the border, 
        and content-box means the background is started from the upper left corner of the content 
        
        border-box:  background-position start from upper left side of the container, include border box
        padding box: background-position start from upper left side of the container, include padding box
        content-box: background-position start from upper left side of the container, exclude it's padding box and fixed
                     into it's container box


    background-clip:
        The background-clip property is used to determine whether the backgrounds extends into the border or not. 
                The default is border-box, which means it DOES extend into it
            border-box
            padding-box
            content-box

    in the image when you set width and height to 100%, it does not fit into it's container width and height, it simple means 
    image size, and might destroy your container and design.

    so its not a good idea to use % in the img css file, better to use em or px

    working on customer page:

    for putting two elements into one line, we can use the combination of display and width
        for example in the customer page, we have a div class with testimonial__image-container, this div hold an image
        and also we have another div right after the above div with some text,
        so, if we want to put these two html elements into one line, we assign display: inline-block in both, then we set width 70%
        in the first div and 20% in the second div, with these trick we can put these two elements into one line. to make it more eye catching, we also set 
        vertical-align: middle

        html
            <div class="image__container">
                <img src="...." >
            </div>

            <div class="testimonal__container>
                <h1> name of the person is:</h1>
                <h2> He is a CEO of ........? </h2>
            </div>
            .
            .
            .
        CSS 
            .image__container {
                display: inline-block;
                width: 70%
            }

            .testimonial__container {
                display: inline-block;
                width: 20%;
            }
