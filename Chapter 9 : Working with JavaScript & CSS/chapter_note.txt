    we want to manipulate the css file with the javascript, load, unload, or change the css file with javascript
    we create a modalinto our main index file. right after div with backdrop class

    we have backdrop and the modal with the css class display: none,
    when a user click on the "start hsoting" tab, we want to show a backdrop (grayish backgroun over the background)
    and then display a pop up modal, to ask user if they want to continue to the start hosting page or not,
    so if user click on the "start hsoting" tab, we need a javascript class to dynamicly change the modal and backdrop css class
     display: none feature.

    add event listener to the buttons of the div element with plan class
    now when user click on the button, a modal and backdrop display changes from none, to block

            javascript we have backgroundImage

            css we have margin-top
            javascript we have marginTop

    - there are two ways toa ccess the css class in javascript
        1- cssClassName.style['css features name like background-image'] we pass css features name as a string
        2- cssClassName.style.backgroundImage we use javaScript file naming in here to access css features. backgroundImage vs background-image
