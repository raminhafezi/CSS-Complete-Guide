    we want to manipulate the css file with the javascript, load, unload, or change the css file with javascript
    we create a modalinto our main index file. right after div with backdrop class

    we have backdrop and the modal with the css class display: none,
    when a user click on the "start hsoting" tab, we want to show a backdrop (grayish backgroun over the background)
    and then display a pop up modal, to ask user if they want to continue to the start hosting page or not,
    so if user click on the "start hsoting" tab, we need a javascript class to dynamicly change the modal and backdrop css class
     display: none feature.
