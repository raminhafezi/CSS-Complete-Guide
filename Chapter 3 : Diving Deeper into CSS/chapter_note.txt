1- useful tips for adding multiple cursor in linux (debian-ubuntu distro)
    alt+click -> usually add another cursor to your vs code, but in dome linux distro
    the alt does not work. To resolve this issue, we can go to the vs code, selection, 
    switch to ctrl+click for m ultiple cursor.

2- remove bullet point from the list item
    we assigned a class to our list items and then in the css file

    .plan__features {
        list-style: none;
    }
3- shadow-box
    
    shadow to the box 
    we then assigned another class name to our middle box and then in the css file
    .plan__highlighted {
        box-shadow : offset-x, offset-y,blur-radius, spread-radius, color
    }

    rgba(red, green, blue, opacity)     
        red, green, blue --> 0 to 255
            0: black
            255: white
        opacity --> 0 to 1
4- font:inherit
    when we add button class, a set of default setting will be assigned to our button tag by the browser
    we can overwrite this style by making changes into the button class in the css file
    .button {
        font: inherit;
    }

    in here we set inheritance priority to the button element and overwrite inheritance of the font which 
    assigned to the button by the browser by the parent of our button tag
    
    
    so, now the font in our button follow the same font of the other html tag element, not the font style
    which will be assigned by the browser by default.

5- button style 
    it is a good idea to change the cursor to pointer when a mouse hover to the button tag
    so it=n the css file for the button class
    {
        cursor: pointer;
    }

6- outline
    outline is a property that can be assigne to an element and it behaves like a border, 
    but it is actually not part of the border. for example when a button is clicked, 
    the outline property will be assigned to its looks/CSS by default by the browser, and it add a rounded blue border
    to our tag element. We can see that and test it if you inspect element in Chrome browser
    when you select an button tag, look at the style section in the inspected element and click on the 
    :hov you can see "Force Element State" and some additional attributes like 
     :active
     :focus
     :focus-within
     :hover
     :visited
    and each of these properties comes with the a ckeck box. So, we can checka and see the behaviour of our browser 
    and we can check how our element will be styled by the browser when it is activated, visited, hovered, or focused

    if for example we checked :hover, then we can check what css stylies will be added to our css file by the browser
    and we can modify it by adding related CSS style into our style file.
    for example if we donot like the browser-default :focus outline, we can remove it by adding following style into our file
    .button_class:focus {
        outline: none;
    }
    

7- Transition

    it is a nice features to add transition and transition delay to the CSS in a case like you
    want to highlight a background or change reverse color and background color in case of
    focus of hover

    it works like this
    .some-css-class: hover,
    .some-css-class: focus,
    .some-css-class: active {
       
        transition-delay: 600ms;
        transition: .75s all
    }
