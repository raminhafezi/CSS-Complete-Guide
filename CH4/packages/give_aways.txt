1- float: measn you overwrite the default positionning and tell browser to 
    push element to the left or right of the page. 

    so with the float, we actually take the element out of the page flow and put it to the right
    or left of the page, in this case, the follow up tags/elements will take the position of 
    our element. and we mess up the element position.
    
    This is why we usually donot want to use float.

    We can use float with the image when we want the text float around our image. thenwe can use float in our image tags

2- clear: both;
    clear is a way of hacking the float. in the previous section we describe that using float will mess-up
    our page flow design since the float mean detatching an element. so the next tag/element will take 
    float element position. We can use a hack to fix this issue

    in the html we simple add a <div></div> after element/tag with floar, and before any other element/
    and assing a class to this dive, like class="clearFix"
    then in the css file. we make 
    
    .clearFix {
        clear: both;
    }

    this means we clear any float and the next tag/element will be fixed in their position instead of 
    jumping and taking the space of the floated element.
