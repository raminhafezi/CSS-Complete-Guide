# CSS-Complete-Guide
#Created by Academind by Maximilian Schwarzmüller, Maximilian Schwarzmüller, Manuel Lorenz

<strong>Requirements</strong>:<br />
You should know the very basics about HTML and web development in general <br />
NO advanced HTML or web development knowledge is required though <br />
NO CSS knowledge is required at all! You'll learn it all in this course! <br />
<br /><br />
<strong>Description</strong> <br />
CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheets - is a "programming language" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into real beautiful websites. <br />
This course covers it all - we start at the very basics (What is CSS? How does it work? How do you use it)? and gradually dive in deeper and deeper. And we do this by showing both practical examples as well as the theory behind it. Getting started with CSS might look easy but there actually is a lot of depth to CSS - hence this course provides different "Tracks" or "Entry points" to exactly meet your demands and reflect you current knowledge level:
<br /><br />
<strong>The Basics Track: </strong><br /> 
Start from scratch, learn CSS from the ground up. You start with lecture 1 and simply follow through to the end.<br />
<strong>The Advanced Track:</strong><br />
You already know the CSS basics, you know what selectors are and how it works but you want to dive in deeper and learn some advanced features and usages.
<br />
<strong>The Expert Track:</strong><br />
 You got the advanced knowledge, too, but you want to dive into things like Flexbox, CSS Grid, CSS Variables or Sass. This track is for you.
Of course this course offers the theory and practical examples - we'll build an entire real course project throughout the course - but there also are multiple assignments, quizzes and challenges for you to practice individual concepts taught throughout the course.
<br />
Talking about the course project - we'll build the frontend (no backend) of a fictional web hosting company. We'll have a starting screen which has different sections, we got a responsive design with an animated side-drawer, we got modals and forms and in general we got a lot of CSS animations, font styles and more!
<br /><br />
Here's what's inside the course in detail - this is all also applied to the mentioned course project:
<br />
1 -The basics about selectors, combinators and how you set up styling rules in general <br />
2 -Properties, values and decalarations <br />

10-Styling forms and form inputs<br />

13-Using the CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox<br />
14-Transforming and animating HTML elements with the help of CSS<br />
15-Writing future-proof CSS with features like CSS variables or best-practice class names<br />
