    - we will work on responsive design in this module.

    www.mydevice.io
        these website listed the actual pixcel and size of the different mobile screen


    - the problem with our website so far is, our website can not recognize the actual device width and height,
        in mobile device we have a pixel to inch ratio. for example in the iphone 8, the pixcel to inch ratio is 2.
        that means the 750 pixcel width of the iphone, convert to 375 pixcel. 
        so our website act the same if it opened in the desktop, a lapop, or a mobile device. in order to tell 
        our website to recognize the actual software(not harware) size of the device screen we need to add a meta 
        tag to our html head section.

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width initial-scale=1.0">

    - media queries and viewport.
        - we need viewport meta tag in our html pages to tell us what is the actual pixel of the device,
        - we also need media queries in our css file, so we can adjust style that need to apply to our html tag
            our website style should be dynamically changes bsed on the user device, an style for the desktop, and another style
            for the mobile device with smaller screen.

    - other options that we have on viewport meta tag in our head element are:
        - user-scalable: can get yes or no attribute, let user on mobile device zoom-in & out
        - maximum-scale: restrict maximum zoom level ex: maximum-scale=2.4
        - minimum-scale: obvious

    - in the mobile first website design, we usually code al my css file for the mobile screen,
        then we use @media for adjusting our style for the desktop screen. so we usually, use @media (max-width: 40rem) {......}
    - we can have more than media query in the same css file. not a problme. but be indfult hat the css file compile from top to bottom
        so if we have something like
            - @media (min-width: 40ram) {font-size: 16rem} and then again undeneath it we have another 
            - @media (min-width: 50rem) {font-size: 20rem}
        then as soon as our page width reach 50rem font size will be change to 20 and there is not way we can get it back to 16
        bacause css file would not compile again

    - the best way to palce media queries is at the end of your css file, after all style features. so simply find it and manipulate it later on.

    - we can use combinator in our media query. something like 
        - @media (min-width: 30rem) and (min-height: 60rem)  and (orientaion: landscape) {
            ... style in here will be applied if both conditions were met.
        }
        '
        -@media (condition 1) , (condition 2) {
            ... style in here will be applied if one of conditioon 1 or 2 was met
        }
