video 101:
    we have different units to use in CSS

        1- pixel: px
        2- percentage: %
        3- root em: rem
        4- em: em
        5- viewport height: vh
        6- viewport width: vw

    if we think that each html has a content, then we have a padding, margin, borde,..
    so, we have font-size for the content, we have padding, boarder, as well as margin.
    then we have width and height of our html tag,
    last we have another 4 attribute that we cab assign the units to them, top, bottom, left, and right.
    so in total, we have 10 attributes for each hatmk tag to assign units to them. 
    Please rememberm display: border-box is we want to assign width and height.

    How is the size calculated?
        we have 4 categories in terms of size calculation.

        1- Absolute Lengths: mostly ignore user setting.
            - px
        2- Viewport Length: Adjust to current viewport
            - vh
            - vw
            - vmin
            - vmax
        3- Font-Relative Lengths: adjust to default size
            - rem
            - em
        4- %  --- Special case
            does this % related to body element, wrapper element, viewport, .... ? how about box height and box width in terms of 
            % ? how  they calculated?

    3 rules to rememberm
        Rule 1: 
            if the containing block has a fixed position (position:fixed) then child element see the containing bloxk as a view port.
